# cricket_simulator_cpp
C++ project of cricket simulator in Programming Fundamentals 
It was my project in the programming fundamentals. 
The files of over and teams are made following the requirement of the project instructions.
There is a over.txt file, where the number of overs are entered before starting. 
Also, the teamA.txt and teamB.txt have the names of the team players. And the team data files have the record of each ball while playing.
